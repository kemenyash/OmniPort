# OmniPort â€“ data transformation and mapping Service

**OmniPort** is a system for uploading, transforming, and converting data between various formats (**CSV, Excel, JSON, XML**) using flexible mapping templates.  

The application allows you to configure field mappings between the source and target formats, store conversion history, and automatically process data from URLs.  
OmniPort is an excellent alternative to paid mapping services: simply create a template for your input and output data, map their fields, run the transformation - and you can obtain a permanent link for data synchronization, for example, with marketplaces like **Amazon**, **eBay**, or other services, without writing additional automation scripts.
